Because I am unable to upload the whole meteor folder as it is too large, you must create a local meteor apppliation on your local host. Once done, move the HTML files in the MeteorHTMLFiles into the Client folder. Additionally move the public folder into the root directory of the Meteor application folder where you can see the Client and Server folders.
